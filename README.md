🙋‍♂️ Hello, I'm Dario, I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Domyn.
I have a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering and a MSc degree in Computer Science at the University of Pisa. 🎓

📚 My main interest is **Artificial Intelligence**, but I'm also passionate about **algorithms, big data and data compression**.

🔨 I mostly work with **Python** and machine learning related frameworks, but my heart will always prefer **C++**

✍️ I have a blog about Machine Learning, gpu programming and more! [Check it out](https://dwarez.github.io/)!

🐧 I'm a Linux enthusiast, currently running on ArchLinux. Here's a [fastfetch](https://i.postimg.cc/HkQRyJgX/snapshot-2024-09-25-17-32-45.png).

📧 I like to help students with their career path so feel free to contact me at ldwarezl@gmail.com if you are in need of help or you have any curiosities about what I study (or just to chat 😄)

🆒 A random list of things I like/I'm interested in: physics, space, chess, distro ricing, memes, WoW, anime, MTG & much, much more
