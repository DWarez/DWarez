🙋‍♂️ Hello, I'm Dario, I have a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering and I'm currently enrolled in a MSc degree in Computer Science at the University of Pisa. 🎓

📚 My main interest is **Artificial Intelligence**, but I'm also passionate about **algorithms, big data and data compression**.

🔨 I mostly work with **Python** and machine learning related frameworks, but my heart will always prefer **C++**

🐧 I'm a Linux enthusiast, even if nowadays I only use it inside Windows 😔

📧 I like to help students with their carrer path so feel free to contact me at ldwarezl@gmail.com if you are in need of help or you have any curiosities about what I study (or just to chat 😄)

🆒 A random list of things I like/I'm interested in: physics, space, chess, distro ricing, memes, WoW, anime, MTG & much, much more
